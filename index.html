          <h1>Weeks 1-6 Overview</h1>
          <p class="date">March 26, 2017</p>
          <p>I am currently starting to blog my training process during week 7, so for now I will give a brief overview of my progress thus far.<br>Before I began my training, it had been a few years since I had really worked out at all.  At the time I could not run a full mile, and could barely run for a few minutes without stopping.  Given that my expertise is in sprinting, I had no idea how to train myself for longer distances.  I heard from a friend about an app called Couch to 5k and decided to download it and get started.  Couch to 5k gives you 3x30-miunte workouts a week for 9 weeks that help prepare you to run a 5k from, I guess, sitting on your couch all day. It started out with interval running consisting of workouts like jog 1 minute, walk 1 minute 30 seconds, on repeat for 30 minutes.  Currently in week 7, I am doing 20-28 minute runs with no walk rest.<br>
            Here is some of the data from my first 7 weeks:
            <ul>
              <li>Total Workouts: 20/27</li>
              <li>Total Distance: 40.4 miles</li>
              <li>Total Time: 10:22:30</li>
            </ul>
           </p>
      </div>

          <h1>My First Post</h1>
          <p class="date">March 26, 2017</p>
          <p>My name is Hiter Harris and welcome to my running blog. Here, I will be recording my experience training to run a 5k race and detailing each week of my progress.<br>  This is my first post so I thought I would give a little background myself.  I am a former college sprinter who specialized in the 100m and 200m.  I have always been opposed to long distances and dreaded anything longer than my specific competition distance.  However, I've noticed that there is something different about people who run these longer distances.  They often have a much deeper passion for running, beyond the competition side of things.  I see many more distance athletes continuing their running after college than my fellow sprinters.  Running seems to be a love affair that continues to grow with them.  This is something I have always envied.  I have no idea if I will ever reach that stage in my running, but I am willing to try my best and see where my 5k training will take me. </p>
